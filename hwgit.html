      <h2>What is GIT? </h2>
      <p>GIT is an open source VCS that stores data as a stream of snapshots. When there are multiple developers working on the same project, Git ensures there are no code conflicts, allows developers to revert to old versions of the code, and has branches so developers can work in parallel to each other. There are three main sections of a Git project: the working directory, the staging area, and the repository. The basic workflow starts with modifying files, staging the files, then committing them, which adds them to the local repository.</p>
      <h2>Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Source code Version Control Systems records changes to files so that users can recall specific versions at a later time. Graphic and web designers especially find this useful as it allows the user to see who else modified the file, who created an issue, and allows reversion back to a previous state.</p>
      <h2>Describe following terms</h2>
      <p>1. Local repository is the place where a full copy of committed code is stored in the computer of each developer. Each developer works in their own repository until they are ready to push the code into a remote repository.
Remote repository is the place code is stored on a server where local repository pushes code into when a developer is ready to work with others, where other developers can see and modify that code
How to use GIT in Team Project – Creating a master branch will help to safeguard the integrity of the project. Each developer will create and checkout a new branch to work in and commit to, then when changes are done, the code is merged into the master branch. This keeps everything neat, merging all your edits into one single commit into the master branch.</p>
